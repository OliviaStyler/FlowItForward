    <h2>What We Do</h2>
    <p>Flow It Forward is a heartfelt donation drive dedicated to making a meaningful impact in the lives of refugees by addressing a critical yet often overlooked need. Every November, Flow It Forward launches its annual donation drive, rallying support from the community. The central focus of this initiative is to provide essential menstrual hygiene products to refugees who often lack access to such necessities. Through their unwavering commitment, Flow It Forward strives to bring dignity and comfort to those in challenging circumstances, exemplifying the power of compassion and collective action. Flow It Forward was started by high school student, Olivia Styler, and is in its third year.

    <h2>The Crisis</h2>
    <p>The menstrual hygiene product crisis has had profound impacts on refugees worldwide, exacerbating the already dire living conditions they face. According to a report by the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), a lack of access to sanitary products has resulted in increased health risks, as many resort to using unsanitary materials, leading to infections and discomfort. Moreover, this crisis also hampers the education and economic opportunities of refugee women and girls, perpetuating cycles of poverty and inequality in already vulnerable communities.
